# node_modules overrides
Sometimes, there are bugs in packages that need to get fixed immediately.

In these cases, these packages can be stored here and listed in the `package.json` like this:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "my-dependency": "./node_modueles_overrides/my-dependency"
  }
}
```

> **WARNING:** Always include the necessary legal files (`LICENSE`, etc.) in an override

## Current overrides
|Package|Reason|
|---|---|
